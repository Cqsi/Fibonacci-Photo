# Fibonacci Photo v1.0

## **Info**
Fibonacci was an Italian mathematician that lived lived in the 12th century. He is regarded as one of the biggest mathematicians ever because of his work on numbers. One of his most notable works is the so called Fibonacci Sequence. It two simple rules:

1. The sequence starts with 0, 1 (or 1, 1)
2. Every next number is the sum of the two previous ones

So the sequence becomes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 ...
There's also a geometric interpretation of the Fibonacci sequence. It tells you that you can create a square with side length of a Fibonacci number, put them together in a pattern so that it always forms a rectangle. It looks like this:

Fibonacci Photo will produce this pattern, but instead of colored squares, you can input an image (only square photos for now) and it will output a new image in this pattern where each square is your inputed image. Quite fun huh?
